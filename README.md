# Hi_to_everyone
I'm just getting started to see what's github
I'm a master of environmental engineering specificly working on climate change and it's effects on our lives and so on 
I'm trying to get familiar with github environment and see how to use others contributions and help others as well
I need to learn data analaysis techniquis for managing large climate data and then the big step is to model climate system related to those data 
so many things I have to learn I have worked with python before but just some basic data structures and loops nothing deep, therefore I need to learn the SQL, visualation with pytho.
